# GtoMnK
is a simple tool that lets you use your Xbox controller to play games that don't have controller support.
It works by making your controller pretend to be a mouse and keyboard. All you need to do is inject or load the DLL into your game.

GtoMnK reads settings from the [`GtoMnK.ini`](https://github.com/SAM1430B/GtoMnK/blob/master/GtoMnK%20dll/Documents/GtoMnK.ini) file for configuration and maps controller buttons using [key codes](https://github.com/SAM1430B/GtoMnK/blob/master/GtoMnK%20dll/Documents/GtoMnK_Keys.txt).
